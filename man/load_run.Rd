\usage{
load_run(upload_dir = "final", analysis = "rnaseq",
  interesting_groups = "description", sample_metadata_file = NULL,
  max_samples = 50, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{upload_dir}{Path to final upload directory. This path is set when
running \code{bcbio_nextgen -w template}.}

\item{analysis}{Analysis type. Supports RNA-seq (\code{rnaseq}; \strong{default}) or
small RNA-seq (\code{srnaseq}).}

\item{interesting_groups}{Character vector of interesting groups. First entry
is used for plot colors during quality control (QC) analysis. Entire vector
is used for PCA and heatmap QC functions.}

\item{sample_metadata_file}{\emph{Optional}. Custom metadata file containing
sample information. Otherwise defaults to sample metadata saved in the YAML
file.}

\item{max_samples}{\emph{Optional}. Maximum number of samples to calculate rlog and
variance stabilization object from DESeq2.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments, saved as metadata.}
}
\value{
\link{bcbioRNADataSet}.
}
\description{
Simply point to the final upload directory output by
\href{https://bcbio-nextgen.readthedocs.io/}{bcbio-nextgen}, and this function
will take care of the rest. It automatically imports RNA-seq counts,
metadata, and program versions used.
}
\note{
When working in RStudio, we recommend connecting to the bcbio-nextgen
run directory as a remote connection over
\href{https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/wiki/SSHFS}{sshfs}.
